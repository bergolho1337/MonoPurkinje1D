Berg:

- purkinje_library
	- Build the desconstructor for the graph data structure
	- Populate the 'grid_cell' linked-list with the nodes from the mesh Purkinje graph
	- Remember to pass the size of the discretization to the set_custom_purkinje_network() ("purkinje.c")

- models_library
	- Fix bug on the Li & Rudy 2011 Purkinje cell model
	- Build more celular model related to Purkinje cell (DiFrancesco Noble, ...)
	- Test each variation of the TenTusscher model (Miocardium, Epicardium and Endocardium) using the 2006 version.
	- Refactor the code of the 'mask_function' module
	- Made more tests with the adaptive mesh when dealing with more than one celular model

- vtk_output
	- Write the solution of the Purkinje in files just like Sachetto
	- Also just after building the Purkinje mesh write this to a VTK file
	- Build a PurkinjeToVTK project that converts the solutions to a VTU format.
		- Read the Purkinje mesh stored in VTK format
		- Read the solution files outputting the value of the nodes  
		- Use the ideas from ConvertVTK project of Sachetto to help ...

Sachetto:

- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
