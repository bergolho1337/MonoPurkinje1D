Berg:

- purkinje_library
	- Test the construct_grid_purkinje() function
		- Verify the solution over a benchmark Purkinje network
		- Later, test with CCO network passed by Rafael ...
	- Check the new fill_discretization_matrix() for the Purkinje Network

- models_library
	- Fix bug on the Li & Rudy 2011 Purkinje cell model
	- Build more celular model related to Purkinje cell (DiFrancesco Noble, ...)
	- Test each variation of the TenTusscher model (Miocardium, Epicardium and Endocardium) using the 2006 version.
	- Refactor the code of the 'mask_function' module
	- Made more tests with the adaptive mesh when dealing with more than one celular model

- vtk_output  
	- Test the PurkinjeToVTK program with other inputs ...

- extras
	- Ask Sachetto for the "big_scar", "small_scar" and "human" ALG meshes files.
	- Decide if the metric of the Purkinje should be in centimeters or in micrometers.

========================================================================================================================================
Sachetto:

- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Finish GUI interface
